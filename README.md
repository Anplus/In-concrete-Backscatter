# In-concrete Backscatter

We present a novel promising self-sensing concrete by introducing a novel functional filler, called EcoCapsule â€“ a battery-free and miniature piezoelectric backscatter node. With the help of EcoCapsules, we can construct a battery-free sensing network inside the concrete building so that to achieve the persistent structural health monitoring.
